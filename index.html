        The daimon is your personal spirit. It is a being which is part of you but not part of your physical it is the essence of who you are without attachment to your physical and mortal form. Without any form, its substance is not known to science. All religions try to point to it.

    <div class="square" id="uncool-square">
        You can have a lot of fun exploring what your personal daimon is. There are said to be ways to invoke it by name. The best way to do this is through meditation and study of your reactions to the moment. Some people think that your daimon is your soul.

    <div class="square" id= "square">
        The Daimon is not your thoughts. It is your actual awareness free of construct. In this way it is not seperate from the gnosis of the world soul.
